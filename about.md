## Features

* Graph Paper uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to incorporate beautiful icons: <i class="fas fa-tag"></i> <i class="fas fa-folder-open"></i> <i class="far fa-calendar-alt"> <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
* Graph Paper features robust, hand-coded SEO support. Graph Paper doesn't use the Jekyll SEO plugin, which gives you more flexibility to change the default settings to fit the needs of your website.
* Graph Paper includes favicon support.
* Graph Paper supports tags and categories beautifully.
* Graph Paper supports multiple authors. Each author has their own page which lists their bio, their picture, their posts, and their social media links.
* Graph Paper features RSS support, both for the site as a whole and for individual authors. Like with SEO, Graph Paper's RSS feeds are hand-coded, which means they are robust and detailed out-of-the-box and easily allow you to modify them to suit your own needs.
* Blog pagination
* Multiple options for your blog archive pages: view the full post, an excerpt, or just a description
* Support for comments via [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)
* Featured images
* Support for Twitter cards, so that links to your website look beautiful when shared on social media
* Social media share buttons for Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and LinkedIn
* A beautiful, simple, and modifiable design which includes template pages for blog posts and portfolios
