# Welcome to Jekyll (And Graph Paper)!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# Graph Paper note: if any field is marked as required, make sure you put in some value for it. If it's marked as required, that's because another page (such as SEO.html) assumes it's there, so if you leave the field blank, then your SEO settings (for example) will get messed up.

url: "https://graphpaper.cncoulter.com" # Required. The base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
