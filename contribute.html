                <h3 class="h2">Request or Add Features</h3>

                <p>Do you wish Graph Paper would add support for a particular feature? Let us know! You can:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/cncoulter/Graph-Paper/issues">Report an issue</a>,</li>
                    <li>Edit the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about#missing-features">missing features section</a> and submit a pull request, or</li>
                    <li>Add the feature and submit a pull request.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 class="h2">Report or Fix Bugs</h3>

                <p>Have you found a bug in our code? <a href="https://github.com/cncoulter/Graph-Paper/issues">Report an issue</a> or patch it and submit a pull request.</p>

                <h3 class="h2">Beautify</h3>

                <p>The whole point of Graph Paper is that people can fork it and repurpose it to make their own websites. That means it's important that the code, as well as the website itself, is clean and beautiful. If the code is confusing to you, it's likely confusing to others as well. Feel free to fork it, clean up the code, and submit a pull request.</p>

                <h3 class="h2">Accessibility</h3>

                <p>Accessibility and universal design are super important, and since Graph Paper is a template upon which many website can be built, it's extra important that we take accessibility seriously.</p>

                <p>Graph Paper strives to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG) level AA. If we're not living up to that standard, please <a href="https://github.com/cncoulter/Graph-Paper/issues">report accessibility issues</a> and/or fork, implement accessibility, and submit pull requests.</p>
