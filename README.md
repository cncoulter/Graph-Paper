# README

Graph Paper is a Jekyll template that incorporates Bootstrap. It's meant to be an easy and quick way to have a Jekyll website/blog with the Bootstrap grid already set up. Like graph paper, this provides you with a flexible grid for you to build off of.

As you can see, it's not quite complete yet.
